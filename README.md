# üëã Hi there, I'm Sheila!

I'm a **Physicist** recently graduated with a **Master's degree in Particle Physics**. Currently, I'm diving into the world of **Scientific Computing**, where I'm exploring:

- üß† Projects involving **Machine Learning** techniques  
- üìä Applications of **Data Analysis**  
- ü§ñ Training **AI models** to automate processes  

My goal is to become more confident and effective in solving real-world problems through code and data. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between science and technology, and I'm constantly learning to improve my skills as a future **Software Engineer**.
